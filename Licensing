This licensing includes the 3-D model of the aircraft, texture, image and script files.
They are my own creation, created with free open source software namely:
- blender (3-D Model)
- gimp (2-D stuff)
- linux (OS)

The sound is taken from FlightGear base package for now.

Default livery ("FG"):
The logo on the tail fin is a manipulated version of The GNU Bold Head from the
FSF (Free Software Foundation) which gave me permission to use it for this Project,
gently remembering me to refer to "free software" not "open source" ;)
